# Auto-generated files - committed once to establish baseline
# Future regenerations should be committed only when semantically significant changes occur

# Note: These patterns are NOT active to allow baseline commit.
# Uncomment after baseline to prevent unnecessary commits of regenerated files:
# *.yaml
# *.json

# Always keep this .gitignore file
!.gitignore
